# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Problems
### Problem 1
We have started a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe as outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) but we don't have anyone good enough to code to finish it! 
- Please implement a complete basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- Please use React and TypeScript throughout, if you know TailwindCSS please expand on what is already provided, otherwise it is fine to use raw styling 
- Both players will play out of the same application, it is sufficient to just switch the current player each time a move is played
- Once a game is completed, I should be able to start another game 


### Problem 2
We are bored with the basic game now, can you make it so the board can be scaled to any size? 
- Add some kind of input which allows me to change the board size
- The board size should be a number between 3 and 15 

## Quickstart
- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
